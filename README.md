# Map Forces
## Idea
Real-time multiplayer strategy/tactic game running in web browser. The map - the playground is divided into multiple squares. 
Players can have control over the map's squares.
Every square produces units in a fixed period of time. The idea is to conquer the most squares to have produced the most units and then conquer the rest.
Of course players can fight with each other by moving their square units over the opponent's squares. Battle result is calculated by the units count difference.
There are no special units nor player's abilities. Player can use only simple move strategies over the battle field.
## Development state
Game's development was suspended in 2020 but there are plans to restore it.
It's possible I will change the UI part engine from Angular (which is totally not any game engine) to Phaser or something similar.
